			<h2>Brief Synopsis of Self</h2>
			<p> Born in southern Connecticut, I am priviledged to have had an idylic childhood. Whilst in middle school, the not-so-idylic pubescent years, my dad was called to a church in northern Virginia. Having met at HDS, both my parents are ordained ministers...which has not been impactful in my identity whatsoever. *I kid.* Soon, a product of FCPS schools, I applied, early-decision, to Elon University. Learning of my admission in Novemeber of 2013, senior year, while stressful, was also freeing, as I had determined the location of my continued education. Recruited by Teach for America, during the fall of 2017, I was relieved, as, despite several internships, the interdisciplinary nature of Public Health was not especially promising, from an immediate employment standpoint. During the summer of 2018, it became clear that life's season would allow me to give my all to teaching. I applied to two other jobs, and chose to work at Mason in August, 2018. A *happy* fact: I met my husband at the age of 15. We dated throughout highschool and college, and were married in Novemeber, 2018. He is a *gift.* A *sad* fact: In a matter of two weeks, on July 18th, 2019, my dad, who exercised more than I, died. The loss is excrutiating. Grief is non-linear. My (only) sister is 17. I enjoy communicating; verbally *and* non-verbally, hiking, and home-making...I have an affinity for wicker and dried flowers. I am wary of stagnancy in personal-growth. 2019 and 2020 have certainly allowed for growth.</p>
