		<h2>Reflections...</h2>
			<p>Proximity breeds empathy. In the context of global suffering, much of life "feels" trivial. For much of my life, my earnest and genuine desire "to help," aligned with the white savior complex, much to my unawareness. I still desire to advocate for the oppressed, while mindful of the truths of "othering" ('the,' 'them,' 'they,' etc.), and literature such as "Toxic Charity," "Dead Aid," "The New Jim Crow," "Evicted," "The Other Wes Moore," "Just Mercy," and so many more. So while me, pointing at the branding of "IJM" and "United Way," is trivial, relatively speaking, the placement of these images has served as practice. This, photo was taken in Jamkhed, India, where I completed a public health practicum. A brief excerpt of a journal entry, "India, I will miss your precious children who led me along slum pathways, enlightening me to a disposition and lifestyle of joy not heartache. I will miss the melodies of your culture...horn banter, lush greens, gentle chants, and fuchsia sarees. I will miss the raw beauty of un-institutionalized maternal care. I will miss your country and your people."</p>
